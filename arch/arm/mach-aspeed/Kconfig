	  The Aspeed AST2400 and AST2500 include a built-in Super I/O
	  device that is normally disabled; say Y here to enable it.

	  WARNING: this has serious security implications: it grants
	  the host read access to the BMC's entire address space.
	  This should thus be left disabled unless required by a
	  specific system.

	  The Aspeed AST2500 include a hardware-supported, UART-based
	  debug interface that is normally disabled; say Y here to
	  enable it.

	  Note that this has security implications: the debug UART
	  provides read/write access to the BMC's entire address
	  space.  This should thus be left disabled on production
	  systems, but may be useful to enable for debugging during
	  development.
